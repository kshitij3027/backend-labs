# active-passive-failover-log-processor

A multi-node log processing service where one primary node handles all traffic while standby nodes monitor its health and automatically take over within 10 seconds if it fails.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **HTTP framework:** FastAPI + Uvicorn
- **Coordination / shared state:** Redis (leader lock, heartbeats)
- **Inter-node health checks:** httpx
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose (primary path) or K3d (alt)
- **Tests:** pytest + pytest-asyncio

## Architecture

```
                  ┌──────────────┐
        traffic → │   primary    │  (active — accepts log writes / queries)
                  │  node-1:8001 │
                  └──────┬───────┘
                         │ heartbeat + leader lock
                         ▼
                   ┌───────────┐
                   │   Redis   │  (lock key + last-heartbeat)

              ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              ▼                     ▼

       └──────────────┘      └──────────────┘
              (idle, watching health; promote on missed heartbeats)
```

### Roles
- **Primary (active):** Holds the leader lock in Redis. Accepts all log ingest + query traffic. Renews its lock TTL every ~2s.
- **Standby (passive):** Polls Redis for the leader lock and the primary's `/health` endpoint. If both indicate failure for ≥10s, the first standby to grab the lock promotes itself.

### Failover sequence (target: <10s)
1. Primary stops renewing its Redis lock (crash / kill / network partition).
2. Lock TTL expires (e.g., 5s).
3. Standbys race to `SET NX` the lock; one wins.
4. Winner flips internal role to `primary`, starts accepting traffic.
5. Total target: end-to-end p95 promotion ≤ 10s.

### HTTP surface (planned, per node)
- `GET /health` — liveness + current role (`primary` / `standby`)
- `GET /role` — current role + lock holder
- `POST /logs` — ingest a log line (rejected with 503 if not primary)
- `GET /logs` — query recent logs (primary only)
- `GET /metrics` — prometheus-style counters (heartbeats, promotions, rejected writes)

## HTTP Endpoints

| Method | Path                            | Status code(s)               | Description                                                                       |
|--------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/health`                       | 200 (PRIMARY) / 503 (other)  | Liveness probe — only PRIMARY returns 200.                                        |
| GET    | `/role`                         | 200                          | Returns `{node_id, state, role, lock_holder, known_winner, term}`.                |
| GET    | `/metrics`                      | 200                          | Prometheus exposition text (counters + `node_state` gauge).                       |
| POST   | `/logs`                         | 201 (PRIMARY) / 503 (other)  | Body: `{message, level?, log_id?}`. Idempotent on client-supplied `log_id`.       |
| GET    | `/logs?limit=N`                 | 200 (PRIMARY) / 503 (other)  | Returns `{logs, count, last_log_id}` for the most recent `limit` entries.         |
| POST   | `/admin/trigger-failover`       | 202 (PRIMARY) / 503 (other)  | Releases the lock and self-demotes; standbys promote within ~6s.                  |
| POST   | `/heartbeat`                    | 200 / 400                    | Debug ping — accepts a `HeartbeatMessage` JSON body (real heartbeat goes via Redis). |
| POST   | `/election/candidacy`           | 200 / 400                    | Internal — receives `ElectionMessage` from peers during elections.                |
| POST   | `/election/result`              | 200 / 400                    | Internal — receives `ElectionResult` from peers; updates `known_winner`.          |

## Failover semantics

The new primary picks up the cluster's monotonic log-id allocator from a
periodic state snapshot the old primary writes to Redis. This means
post-promotion `last_log_id` and `log_count` are continuous — clients
keep seeing strictly-increasing ids across a failover.

A few subtleties worth being explicit about:

- **Snapshot cadence.** The primary writes its snapshot every
  `STATE_SYNC_INTERVAL` seconds (default `5`). On an uncoordinated
  primary kill (`SIGKILL`, host crash, network partition), **up to ~5
  seconds of writes can be lost** — the lost writes here are *the
  ability to dedup retries of those exact ids* and *the precise
  pre-failover `log_count` value*; the new primary's allocator is still
  monotonic because `_next_id` is always seeded past `snap.last_log_id +
  1`.
- **Counters, not payloads.** The snapshot persists the
  `LogProcessor` *counters* (`_next_id`, `_seen_ids`, derived
  `last_log_id` / `log_count`) — it does **not** ship the actual log
  entries. Replicating the log payload is a separate problem (Kafka /
  Raft / cross-DC); this lab restricts scope to "the cluster's view of
  itself stays continuous across promotion".
- **Clean failover (manual / SIGTERM)** is no fresher than the last
  scheduled snapshot. The release-lock path inside `stop()` does not
  force an extra snapshot — it's purely time-driven. If you want
  zero-loss failover you'd take an extra `snapshot_now()` immediately
  before releasing the lock; that's a deliberate non-feature here.
- **Schema versioning.** A snapshot whose `version` doesn't match the
  loader's `schema_version` is refused — the new primary boots with
  fresh-zero counters and logs a warning. Bump the version whenever the
  snapshot dataclass shape changes.

## Resilience patterns

Inter-node election traffic is wrapped in two layered protections so a
single dead peer can't drag down an election:

### Circuit breaker (per peer)

Each ``(host, port)`` peer gets its own ``CircuitBreaker`` with three
states:

* **CLOSED** — calls pass through.
* **OPEN** — after **5 consecutive failures**, the breaker opens and
  every subsequent call is rejected immediately (``CircuitBreakerOpen``)
  without touching the network. The breaker stays OPEN for **30
  seconds** before allowing one trial.
* **HALF_OPEN** — exactly one trial call after the cooldown elapses.
  Success closes the breaker; failure re-opens it and resets the clock.

The ``InterNodeClient`` returns ``False`` when a breaker is OPEN, just
as it does for any transport failure — peer-down is the *normal* path
during failover and must never propagate as an exception.

Counters are aggregated across all peers and exposed at ``/metrics``:

* ``circuit_breaker_failures_total`` — sum of failed calls across every
  peer's breaker.
* ``circuit_breaker_opens_total`` — sum of times any breaker has
  opened.

### Bulkhead (per call type)

The ``InterNodeClient`` keeps two ``asyncio.Semaphore`` budgets:

* ``send_candidacy`` — **3 concurrent** in-flight calls.
* ``send_election_result`` — **3 concurrent** in-flight calls.

The two budgets are independent: a candidacy storm cannot starve the
result broadcast (or vice versa). Three slots is comfortable headroom
for a 3-node cluster (each election fans out to 2 peers) while
preventing runaway parallelism if something upstream retries
aggressively.

Heartbeat traffic is intentionally NOT routed through this client — it
flows via Redis directly — so no semaphore or breaker is needed for
that path.

## How to Run
> _To be filled in once the implementation lands. Will be a single `docker compose up` that spins up Redis + 3 nodes (1 primary, 2 standby) on ports 8001-8003._

Once Commit 4a lands, `docker compose up --build` will spin up Redis + 3 nodes on ports 8001-8003. (Commit 1 ships only the scaffold; the node service entrypoint is added in Commit 4a.)

- _How to size lock TTL vs. heartbeat interval to balance false-failover risk against detection latency._
- _Split-brain windows: what happens during the gap between "primary loses network" and "lock TTL expires."_
