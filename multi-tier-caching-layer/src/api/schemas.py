"""Pydantic response envelopes for the cache REST API.

These thin wrappers shape the dicts produced by the metrics aggregator, the L1/
L2 tiers, the pattern engine, and the cache manager into the exact JSON the
dashboard and the e2e/integration tests consume, so the route handlers in
:mod:`src.api.routes_cache` stay declarative.

The fields lean on permissive ``dict`` typing on purpose — the underlying
``Metrics.snapshot()`` / ``L1Cache.stats()`` / ``L2Redis.stats()`` shapes are
already well-defined elsewhere and we don't want to duplicate (or risk drifting
from) their structure here. The one contract C15 must hold (project §8) is that
``performance.overall_hit_rate`` and ``performance.total_requests`` are always
present, which the route assembles explicitly.

    tiers:
        Per-tier breakdown with ``l1``/``l2``/``l3`` (and ``backend``) sub-dicts.
    memory:
        Approximate memory accounting: ``l1_mb`` (L1 value footprint),
        ``cap_mb`` (the configured cross-tier cap), and ``total_mb``
        (best-effort total across tiers).
    timing_ms:
        Cached-vs-uncached latency percentiles/averages in milliseconds.
    degraded:
        Whether the L2 (Redis) tier is currently degraded.
    alert:
        A degradation-alert dict, or ``None`` when healthy.
