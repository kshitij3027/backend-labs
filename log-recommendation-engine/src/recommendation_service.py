"""Recommendation orchestration — the full ``POST /recommend`` pipeline (C9).

This is the composition root that wires every prior stage into one call:

    embed query  ->  pgvector retrieve candidates  ->  contextual score
                 ->  weighted-blend rank            ->  top-K suggestions

Each suggestion carries the matched historical incident's **resolution** (the fix)
plus a per-signal score breakdown, so the response is directly actionable and
self-explaining. The served result is persisted (a :class:`Recommendation` row, so
C10 feedback can reference it) and cached in Redis (so an identical repeated query
is answered without recomputing).

Design notes
------------
* **Reuse, don't reimplement.** Embedding (:mod:`src.embeddings`), retrieval
  (:mod:`src.retrieval`), contextual scoring (:mod:`src.contextual`) and ranking
  (:mod:`src.ranker`) are all consumed as-is. This module is *only* orchestration
  + persistence + cache.
* **Soft-by-default hybrid.** By default retrieval is pure semantic and the
  contextual signals act as soft preferences (same service / close severity /
  shared tags are *rewarded*, not *required*). A caller opts into hard constraints
  with ``restrict_service`` / ``restrict_severity``; if a hard filter is too narrow
  to fill ``top_k`` we widen by re-retrieving without it (logged).
* **Feedback closes the loop (C11).** The learned per-pattern ``suggestion_scores``
  are folded into ranking as a smoothed net-helpfulness term, and the response cache
  is **epoch-invalidated per pattern** so a vote changes the very next identical
  ``/recommend`` (the cache key embeds the pattern's feedback epoch, which every vote
  bumps — see :func:`src.clients.redis.get_feedback_epoch`).
* **Fault tolerance.** The Redis cache is best-effort on both read and write — if
  Redis is down we simply recompute and return ``cached=False`` (the epoch read also
  degrades to ``0``, so the base cache key is used). An empty corpus / no candidates
  returns an empty (``count=0``) response, never a 500.
