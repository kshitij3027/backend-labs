# Log Processing Pipeline

An end-to-end pipeline that generates, collects, parses, stores, and queries log data using five integrated components.

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.12
- Runtime: Long-lived orchestrator process + interactive CLI query tool

## Components

1. **Log Generator** — produces realistic, configurable log output
2. **Log Collector** — watches and captures log data in real time
3. **Log Parser** — normalizes raw logs into structured JSON
4. **Log Storage** — persists structured logs with rotation and compression
5. **Log Query CLI** — interactive tool to search, filter, and analyze stored logs
